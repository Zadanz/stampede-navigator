## Map
On the map, scroll or press the plus (+) button to get a clearer view of the building shapes on the map

Clicking the red pin icons will provide a simple navigation route from the users location (marked with the blue pin as "home").


## Events Panel
The events panel can be open and closed using the yellow double arrow (<< when open >> when closed) button on the side of the panel. When closed, the side button will still be avalible to the user, and is labeled "All Events" so the user can clearly distinguish the closed tab.

When the events panel is open, the user can filter the results using the checkboxes on the side. Multiple filters can be selected to show multiple event types.

The search bar filters the events as the user types. If the letter "c" is typed, the chuck wagon event and t-pain concert will populate the events panel, and the search bar will suggest what event the user may be trying to type.

If the user clicks on the white button with an event title a description of the event, with its location and recommended audience age will display. Multiple of these descriptions can be viewed at once so that the user can compare event descriptions with ease.

The red buttons that display a time under the listed events will add the event to the schedule. A message display if the user adds overlapping events, which can be dismissed. Events can be easily removed from the schedule by retoggling the time button.
